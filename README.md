# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out a QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## The solution

- The design has been kept simple, mostly using display: block and only using flex to place the card in the centre of the screen.
- The width of the card was max'd at 400px and responsive to smaller sizes. This has been done for card reusability rather than specifially this use-case.

## Additions

Enhancements to the original spec include:
- Adding a box shadow to make the card stand out
- Putting in a rotating background gradient to enhance the overall UX
